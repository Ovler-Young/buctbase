## Discussion

Please go to our [discussion forum](https://github.com/spencerwooo/onedrive-vercel-index/discussions) for general questions and FAQs, **issues are for bug reports and bug reports only.** Feature requests may or may not be ignored, as [I (@spencerwooo)](https://spencerwoo.com) am the only one maintaining the project, so **I only prioritise features that I use.**

*Of course, I accept sponsors and donations* :3

## Demo

## Deployment

> No time to write deployment documentation! Here are some quick hints, play around with caution! (I promise detailed docs are on the way.)

- Fork the project to your own account, as you will be maintaining your custom version of this project with your own configurations.
- Change configuration file [`config/api.json`](config/api.json) and [`config/site.json`](config/site.json) according to your configs.
- Define environment variables inside Vercel: `REFRESH_TOKEN`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Deploy inside Vercel, profit.

The authentication tokens and variables are the same as what you configured in the [`onedrive-cf-index`](https://github.com/spencerwooo/onedrive-cf-index) project. Detailed documentations can also be found there (for now). This project is at its early stages, for discussions *please, please, please* post to the [discussion forum](https://github.com/spencerwooo/onedrive-vercel-index/discussions).

### Password protected folders

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32114380/146787150-fb30c5fe-7fdf-4de6-bd43-1bd0a98547b0.mp4

You can now specify a `.password` under a folder, declare the directory's absolute path, to password-protect the route and all files inside.

- Declare protected route inside `config/site.json` under `protectedRoutes`, for instance:

  ```
  "protectedRoutes": [
    "/🌞 Private folder/u-need-a-password",
    "/🥟 Some test files/Protected route"
  ],
  ```

- Add `.password` file under the root protected folder, redeploy your project on Vercel. Profit.

However, there are some caveats:

- Function is not entirely reliable and may be largely vulnerable to all kinds of threats. DO NOT use for protecting sensitive information.
- Protected files cannot be shared through `?raw=true` url parameters.

### Multi-file and folder download

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32114380/146787219-0d546eb6-71dc-4c3c-8871-86dde1d98ffb.mp4

We use JSZip to download all files in-browser and compress them into file blobs, which are then downloaded to your device as a `zip` file. This is extremely useful if a series of small files are to be downloaded, but it could be time consuming if used for bulk-downloading a few large files.

Folders are traversed and recursively fetched into the compressed zip. Multiple files or folders can be selected and downloaded side-by-side.

### OneDrive as your website's image storage

Yes, it can be used as an image (or any kind of file) online storage, where the raw file link is exported and can be embedded into your blog or other websites. Images, videos, songs, PDFs..., you name it.

### Server-*less*?

Yes! Completely free with no backend server what-so-ever.
